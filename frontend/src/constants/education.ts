    overview: [
      "Fixed deposits, also known as term deposits or certificates of deposit (CDs), are financial instruments offered by banks and financial institutions where you deposit money for a specified period at a fixed interest rate. They offer guaranteed returns and principal safety, making them one of the safest investment options.",
      "While fixed deposits typically provide lower returns compared to stocks or mutual funds, they play a crucial role in a balanced portfolio by offering stability, predictable returns, and capital preservation. They're particularly valuable for emergency funds, short-term goals, and conservative investors."
    ],
    keyPoints: [
      "Fixed deposits offer guaranteed returns at predetermined interest rates",
      "Term lengths can range from a few months to several years",
      "Early withdrawal usually incurs penalties or reduced interest",
      "Interest rates typically increase with longer deposit terms",
      "Most fixed deposits are insured up to certain limits by government programs"

          "Interest can be paid periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually) or at maturity. Compound interest options allow interest to be reinvested, maximizing returns over the deposit term."
        ],
        example: "If you deposit $10,000 in a 3-year FD with a 3% annual interest rate and annual compounding, at maturity you'll receive approximately $10,927.27. This represents your principal plus $927.27 in interest earnings."
