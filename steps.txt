Based on the logs and code analysis, here are the key optimizations needed to reduce API calls and improve performance:

Centralized User Permission Management
Create a global permission state manager to cache user permissions
Use React Context to share permission data across components
Implement a single initial permission check on app load
Add periodic refresh mechanism instead of checking on every component mount
Batch Like Status Checks
Instead of checking like status for each post individually, create a new endpoint that accepts an array of post IDs
Return a map of post IDs to like status in a single API call
Cache like status results client-side
Subscription Status Caching
Implement client-side caching for subscription status
Add cache invalidation on subscription changes
Reduce polling frequency for subscription status checks
Request Deduplication
Add request deduplication for permission and subscription checks
Implement a request queue system to prevent duplicate in-flight requests
Share pending request results across components
Backend Optimization
Add proper database indexing for frequently queried fields
Implement server-side caching for user permissions
Batch database operations where possible
